# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Below is a code snippet that demonstrates polymorhpism because
the class Programmer inherits the makeFriend class but changes it's functionality. Despite having the same name for the function, the implementation is dofferent.

```jsx
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.friends = [];
  }
  makeFriend(friend) {
    this.friends.push(friend)
    console.log(`Hi ${friend}, my name is ${this.name}, nice to meet you!`);
  }
}

class Programmer extends Person {
  // the constructor can be inherited too as long as the signature doesn't need changing

  // here we totally override the parent method
  makeFriend(friend) {
    this.friends.push(friend);
    console.log('tap tap tap');
  }
}
```
